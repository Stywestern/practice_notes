2. Select the sheet names you want to merge from the dropdowns.
3. Press "Select Columns" button.
4. Select the columns you want to use for merging from each sheet.
5. Press "Confirm & Merge" button to merge the selected columns from all sheets.
6. Select the columns you want to keep in the merged file from the checkbox.
7. Press "Confirm & Save" button.

File will automatically open, but will also be saved in the outputs/merged_files folder.
NOTE: The columns on the checkboxes follow have suffixes like "_second, _third", that indicates these columns are shared in other files, and no suffix means it is the first instance of that column.
